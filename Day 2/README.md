# Day #2: Let's Get Blinky!

## Overview
Day 2 of the Codemas Advent Challenge introduces us to LEDs, a fundamental component in electronics. Today's session is about programming LEDs to perform various light patterns, enhancing our understanding of GPIO pins and MicroPython functions.

## Box #2 Contents
- 5mm Red LED (clear lens)
- 5mm Amber LED (clear lens)
- 5mm Green LED (clear lens)
- Three 330 ohm resistors
- Four male-to-male jumper wires

## Today's Project
We're setting up a circuit on the breadboard and writing MicroPython code to light up LEDs, make them flash, and run in sequences.
