# Codemas Advent Challenge

## Introduction

Season's greetings! I've embarked on the Codemas Maker Advent Calendar journey, diving daily into the world of the RP2040. It's an exciting escape into the Raspberry Pi realm, offering a fresh project each day. This repository is neatly organized by days, so you can easily explore and replicate each project at your leisure. 

## Personal Reflection

This challenge has been an invigorating departure from my day to day work at HLR Lookup, offering a hands-on introduction to MicroPython and Raspberry Pi intricacies. Perfect for any coder looking to mix things up this festive season!
