# Day #1: Getting Started

## Overview

Welcome to Day 1 of the Codemas Advent Challenge! Today, we set the foundation for our upcoming projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico H. You'll get hands-on experience installing software and running basic MicroPython code.

## Box #1 Contents

- Raspberry Pi Pico H (pre-soldered headers)
- 1m Micro-USB cable
- 400-point solderless breadboard

## Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi Pico

Follow the provided instructions to install Thonny IDE and configure it for the Raspberry Pi Pico. Youâ€™ll also learn how to install MicroPython firmware onto the Pico.

## Today's Project

We start simple by running a 'print' command and then progress to controlling the Pico's onboard LED.

## Additional Activities

Check the repository for additional commented-out code blocks, offering variations like blinking and frequency modulation for you to try at your leisure.
